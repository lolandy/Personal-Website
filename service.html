        <h1 class="service_title">The Big Event</h1>
        <p>Every year in the spring, Texas A&M University holds a volunteering event with over 14,000 participants. 
        Students go out to the local community and help homeowners with services like landscaping or painting.
        I participated in the Big Event last year with a group of about ten people. 
        We went to the home of an elderly woman and helped her spread mulch on flowerbeds.
        The work we did was tough but fulfilling and the yard look great when we finished. 
        The woman was happy with the final result and it felt good to serve the community.

        <h1 class="service_title">Corps of Cadets</h1>
        <p>The Corps is the oldest and largest student organization on campus with over 2300 members. 
        Selfless service is one of our core values and our mission is to develop well-educated leaders for the future.
        As a junior, my responsibility is to inspire and serve the twenty-five freshman cadets in our unit. 
        I motivate the freshman during tough workouts and help them surpass their limits.
        I also help them maintain disciplined study habits and give tutoring on programming assignments.
        Freshman year is the most difficult one in the Corps and it can feel overwhelming.
        I hope to serve as a role model and leave a lasting impact on the class of 2027.

        <h1 class="service_title">TAMU Technology Services</h1>
        <p>I work as a part-time technician for the Texas A&M information technology department. 
        My job involves assisting students and staff with issues encountered on school websites or software.
        The skill I developed the most on this job is communication and professionalism. 
        Almost every problem I encountered is different so I need to listen intently and think on my feet.
        Even if I can not find a solution, I communicate my thought process and recommend other plans of action.
        During the last year, I helped resolve over a hundred different issues with over a 90% satisfaction rate.
